## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
At the top of the dashboard, I designed five KPI cards to highlight the most important library metrics:
-	Total Sales
-	Total Profit

-	These KPI cards automatically update when filtered using slicers, making them dynamic and highly responsive.
## Interactive Charts and Visualizations
To provide clearer insights, I added multiple charts powered by PivotTables:
- Profit by year (colunmu chart)
Shows annual profitability trends, enabling easy identification of growth or decline.
- sales by sub categores (Funnel chart)
Breaks down sales performance across product sub‑categories for granular analysis.
- top 5 customer profits (Bar Chart)
Highlights the most profitable customers, supporting targeted relationship management.
- sales by month (colunmu chart)
Displays monthly sales fluctuations to identify seasonal patterns.
- sales by State (Funnel chart)
Performance, revealing regional strengths and opportunities.
- Monthly Trends (2024 - 2025) (colunmu chart) 
Tracks recent performance trends to support forecasting and strategic planning.


The chart highlights relative contributions rather than just raw totals, which helps in identifying shifts in sales patterns between the two years.
Each chart is clean, color-coded, well-labeled, and scales automatically when filters are applied.
## Slicers for Interactive Filtering
To make the dashboard truly dynamic, I added four slicers:
- Year
- Category 
- Months
These slicers ensure that the dashboard remains interactive, flexible, and responsive, empowering users to explore the data from multiple angles.
